# NOTE:
# What is range()?
# The range() class helps us generates an arithmetic progression object and lets us create a sequence type object based on the given start, stop and step values. Range is different type of sequence  A range() object will always take the same amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents as it only stores. As it only stores the start, stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed.

# Checking the type of range in Python:
print(type(range))

r = range(10)
print(list(r))
