# Polymorphism : Greek work that means to "have many forms or faces"
#                Poly means many
#                Morphe means form

#                Two ways to achieve polymorphism:
#                1. Inheritance: An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class. 
#                2. "Duck Typing": Object must have necessary attributes/methods
